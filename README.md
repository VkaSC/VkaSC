# Hi GitHub comunity!!! :earth_africa:
## *I'm going to share with you some of my secrets* :unlock: :
# *I love coffee* :coffee:  # *read*  :book: # skate arround the city and of corse... # *coding* :computer: 

I'm starting so right now I have little to share, my life is a script....

**I get up**
`git pull` 

**prepare coffee** 
`git add .`

**sit at the computer to type code**
:clock9: :clock11: :clock1230: :clock3: **...**

**go to class and keep typing code**
:clock4: :clock6: " :coffee: " :clock7: :clock830: **...**
`git commit -m "Remember everything"`

**back home:**
`git push origin CodeSpace`
**I collapse on the bed**

## At the moment..... thats my live :information_desk_person:  but ...
# I am happy, enthusiastic and excited
